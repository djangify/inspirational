          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            I live what I teach. I have self-authored my life. That means I have actively taken control of my own life story, rather than letting the opinion of others dictate my path. I make intentional choices aligned with my values. This is what decides the direction of my life.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
          My aim now, through the digital products I create, is to support women who are ready to live with purpose and feel more in control of the choices that shape their life.</p>

          I am an INFJ introvert. A 29/11 path walker and a 6/2 Role Model/Hermit - Pure Generator - Human Design. What does all that mean? I was born to guide people towards transformation.

        <p class="text-gray-600">As an INFJ — often called the Advocate or the Insightful Idealist — I am someone who blends introspection with a strong sense of purpose. INFJs are known for their deep thinking, empathy, and desire to make a meaningful impact. We often feel a quiet pull toward something bigger than ourselves — not for recognition, but because living with purpose matters deeply to us.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">According to Dan Millman’s The Life You Were Born to Live, my life path is 29/11, a journey centered on spiritual growth, balance, and learning to trust my inner wisdom.
        I am here to build trust, not just in others, but in myself and the quiet voice that guides me forward. It is not always been easy, but it has shaped the way I approach life, work, and purpose: with a steady commitment to personal growth and a desire to help others reconnect with their own sense of meaning.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">In Human Design, I am a Generator, which means I am built to follow what energises and excites me and when I’m not, I feel it in my body as frustration. That’s my cue to pause, reassess, and realign.</P>

        <p class="text-gray-600">My profile is 6/2 — the Role Model Hermit who lives life in stages. In this stage of life (over 50), I am stepping into a more natural role as a guide and example — not because I have all the answers, but because I have lived through enough to speak from experience. The “2” in me needs solitude to recharge and reflect. </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            I am a certified personal growth coach, NLP Master Practitioner (accredited via ANLP-certified training) and the creator behind Inspirational Guidance.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed lg:text-xl">
          I bring over two decades of experience in coaching, NLP, and personal development — backed by professional certifications and practical tools. These credentials reflect my commitment to offering grounded, transformative support for women ready to grow.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed lg:text-xl">
          I have also trained in other techniques including Appreciate Inquiry and EFT - Emotional Freedom Technique.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed lg:text-xl">
          I moved away from Life Coaching and spent time as an Online Marketer and Virtual Assistant. All of these skills are now helping me build this personal growth hub. While I loved helping others build their dream, the inner calling for me to return to mine is why this exists.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed lg:text-xl">
          Each qualification represents a step in my journey — from communication and mindset work to professional coaching. They're not just pieces of paper — they're tools I draw from to help women build confidence and clarity.
