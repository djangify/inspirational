    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Diana Morgan is the editor behind every product, prompt, and page. She’s not here to be followed — she’s here to support. Her goal is to make practical personal growth feel calm, capable, and doable.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      She’s not a life coach. More of a printable strategist with a soft spot for A4.

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Hi — I’m Diane Corriette. I’ve always been drawn to personal growth, and this site is the most honest version of that I’ve ever created. I’m an introvert who prefers to stay behind the scenes, and AI has given me a way to rebuild this platform without needing to be the face of it.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      I’m real. I exist. I’ve trained in NLP and mindfulness, and if you search my name, you’ll find me. This is my voice, my creativity, and my lived experience — just not my face.

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Some of the content on this site is written with the help of AI — but every word is reviewed and edited by me, Diane. I use AI to remove the heavy lifting of content creation and to repurpose my ideas faster and more clearly.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Nothing here is generated without thought. AI is my assistant, not my voice.
