      <p>At Inspirational Guidance, we believe in full transparency about how our content is created. Some of our digital products, blog posts, and resource descriptions are developed with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including tools like ChatGPT.</p>

      <p>We use AI to help with idea development, drafting, summarising, or structuring content — but all final materials are reviewed, edited, and curated by a human: Diane Corriette. Nothing is published without her direct involvement and approval.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Why We Use AI</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>To speed up content creation and reduce manual effort</li>
        <li>To repurpose ideas and resources into different formats (guides, prompts, blog posts)</li>
        <li>To help organise and clarify messaging based on Diane's voice and original writing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>AI is a tool — not a replacement for human experience. We treat it as a thoughtful assistant that helps make our work more accessible, clear, and helpful.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">What This Means for You</h2>
      <p>Every product and article you read on Inspirational Guidance has been guided by human intent and checked for quality, accuracy, and tone. If you’re ever unsure about the source of something, feel free to reach out and ask.</p>

      <p>Diane believes deeply in creating real-world resources that are emotionally steady, non-performative, and rooted in experience — not automation. That will never change.</p>
